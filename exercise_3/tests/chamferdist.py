#TODO: Implement Chamfer Distance Metric w/ G.T Mesh

# Read the GT meshes

# Read the generated meshes from the validation set

# Generate random points samples https://www.fwilliams.info/point-cloud-utils/sections/mesh_sampling/#generating-random-samples-on-a-mesh
# The paper used 30K points for distance measurement we also can use the same number OR since paper calculated SDFs with 16K points and we used 1/4 of it, we can use 10K points

# Calculate chamfer distance https://www.fwilliams.info/point-cloud-utils/sections/shape_metrics/
