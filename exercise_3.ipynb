    "Here, we will take a look at 3D-reconstruction using [DeepSDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05103). We recommend reading the paper before attempting the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepSDF is an auto-decoder based approach that learns a continuous SDF representation for a class of shapes. Once trained, it can be used for shape representation, interpolation and shape completion. We'll look at each of these\n",
    "applications.\n",

    "<img src=\"exercise_3/images/deepsdf_teaser.png\" alt=\"deepsdf_teaser\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/>\n",

    "During training, the autodecoder optimizes both the network parameters and the latent codes representing each of the training shapes. Once trained, to reconstruct a shape given its SDF observations, a latent code is\n",
    "optimized keeping the network parameters fixed, such that the optimized latent code gives the lowest error with observed SDF values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage that implicit representations have over voxel/grid based approaches is that they are not tied to a particular grid resolution, and can be evaluated at any resolution once trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to previous exercise, we'll first download the processed dataset, look at the implementation of the dataset, the model and the trainer, try out overfitting and generalization over the entire dataset, and finally inference on unseen samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (a) Downloading the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas volumetric models output entire 3d shape representations, implicit models like DeepSDF work on per point basis. The network takes in a 3D-coordinate (and additionally the latent vector) and outputs the SDF value at the queried point. To train such a model,\n",
    "we therefore need, for each of the training shapes, a bunch of points with their corresponding SDF values for supervision. Points are sampled more aggressively near the surface of the object as we want to capture a more detailed SDF near the surface. For those curious,\n",
    "data preparation is decribed in more detail in section 5 of the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the ShapeNet Sofa class for the experiments in this exercise. We've already prepared this data, so that you don't need to deal with the preprocessing. For each shape, the following files are provided:\n",
    "- `mesh.obj` representing the mesh representation of the shape\n",
    "- `sdf.npz` file containing large number of points sampled on and around the mesh and their sdf values; contains numpy arrays under keys \"pos\" and \"neg\", containing points with positive and negative sdf values respectively\n",

Name it with your matriculation number(s) as described in exercise 1. Make sure this notebook can be run without problems. Then, submit via Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The maximum submission file size limit for Moodle is 100M. You do not need to submit your overfitting checkpoints; however, the generalization checkpoint will be >200M. The easiest way to still be able to submit that one is to split it with zip like this: `zip -s 100M model_best.ckpt.zip model_best.ckpt` which creates a `.zip` and a `.z01`. You can then submit both files alongside another zip containing all your code and outputs.\n",
